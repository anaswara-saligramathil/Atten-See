# AttenSee

## Basic Details
It detects distractions (like phone usage), tracks gaze/head pose, computes a focus score, and generates intelligent alerts — all running client-side for privacy and speed.

### Project Description
AttenSee is an AI-powered behavioral analytics web application that helps students improve focus using real-time computer vision, attention scoring, and automated study tools.

It detects distractions (like phone usage), tracks gaze/head pose, computes a focus score, and generates intelligent alerts — all running client-side for privacy and speed.

### The Problem statement
Students lose focus frequently but lack real-time awareness of when and why it happens. Traditional timers only track time — not attention quality.

There is no system that:
1.Detects real distractions in real-time
2.Measures attention objectively
3.Converts lectures into automated study materials

### The Solution
AttenSee combines:

 *Client-side ML (COCO-SSD + MediaPipe)
 *Real-time focus scoring
 *Programmatic alerts
 *Whisper-based transcription
 *Gemini-powered summaries & flashcards
